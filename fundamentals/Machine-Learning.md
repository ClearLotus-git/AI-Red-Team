# Introduction to Machine Learning (Notes)

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Broad field: systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence (reasoning, perception, problem-solving, learning).
- Main areas:
  - NLP → computers understand/generate language
  - Computer Vision → image/video recognition
  - Robotics → autonomous/semi-autonomous robots
  - Expert Systems → mimic human decision-making
- Goal: augment human decision-making & productivity
- Applications:
  - Healthcare → diagnosis, drug discovery
  - Finance → fraud detection, investments
  - Cybersecurity → threat detection, mitigation

## Machine Learning (ML)
- Subfield of AI → systems learn from data without explicit programming
- Uses stats to find patterns → predictions/decisions
- Types:
  - **Supervised** → labeled data (image classification, spam detection)
  - **Unsupervised** → unlabeled data (customer segmentation, anomaly detection)
  - **Reinforcement** → trial/error + rewards (games, robotics, self-driving)
- Example: train model on "cat"/"dog" labeled images, then predict new ones
- Applications:
  - Healthcare → diagnosis, personalized medicine
  - Finance → fraud, risk assessment, trading
  - Marketing → segmentation, recommendations
  - Cybersecurity → malware/threat detection
  - Transport → traffic prediction, autonomous cars

## Deep Learning (DL)
- Subfield of ML → neural networks with many layers
- Strengths:
  - Learns hierarchical features (edges → shapes → objects)
  - End-to-end learning (raw input → output, no manual features)
  - Scales well with big data + GPUs
- Types of networks:
  - **CNNs** → images/videos
  - **RNNs** → sequences (text, speech)
  - **Transformers** → NLP, self-attention, long-range dependencies
- Applications:
  - Computer Vision → classification, object detection
  - NLP → sentiment analysis, translation, chatbots
  - Speech → transcription, synthesis
  - Reinforcement Learning → agents for games, robotics

## Relationship (AI vs ML vs DL)
- AI = big circle (intelligent systems)
- ML = subset (learning from data)
- DL = subset of ML (multi-layer neural nets)
- ML/DL power many AI applications:
  - Computer Vision → supervised + CNNs
  - NLP → ML + Transformers
  - Autonomous Driving → ML + DL process sensors, detect objects, decide actions
  - Robotics → reinforcement learning + DL
- DL enhances ML by handling complex/unstructured data
- Together, AI + ML + DL → drive innovation in multiple industries
