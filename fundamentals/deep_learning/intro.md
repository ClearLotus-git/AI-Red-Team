# Introduction to Deep Learning — Summary

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to automatically learn complex patterns from raw data. These networks are inspired by the human brain and are capable of solving advanced problems without the need for manual feature extraction.

Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning models learn hierarchical representations of data through multiple hidden layers. This power makes them highly effective in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and robotics.

Key components of deep learning include:
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** – interconnected neurons organized into layers
- **Layers** – input, hidden, and output layers that process and transform data
- **Activation functions** – introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- **Backpropagation** – adjusts weights based on prediction errors
- **Loss functions** – measure how incorrect predictions are
- **Optimizers** – control how weights are updated (e.g., SGD, Adam)
- **Hyperparameters** – predefined settings such as learning rate and number of layers

Together, these elements allow deep learning models to improve over time and solve complex tasks that were previously difficult or impossible for machines.
